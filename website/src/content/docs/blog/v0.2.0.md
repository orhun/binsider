`binsider` is a terminal UI tool for analyzing the binary files.

Take a look at the [documentation](https://binsider.dev/) if you are new around here üòé

## What's new?

Click [here](https://github.com/orhun/binsider/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the full changelog.

### Better platform support

The [dynamic analysis feature](/usage/dynamic-analysis) is now optional and gated behind the `dynamic-analysis` feature flag.

This change allows `binsider` to run on platforms where the dynamic analysis is not supported, e.g., macOS and Windows.

To build, run the following command:

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

### Run with args

Now it is possible to [dynamically analyze](/usage/dynamic-analysis) binaries with their CLI arguments. This feature is useful for analyzing binaries that require specific arguments to run correctly, e.g:

```sh
binsider "python test.py"
```

### Nix flake

I know y'all like Nix, so we have a Nix flake for `binsider` now! ‚ùÑÔ∏è

```bash
nix run "github:orhun/binsider"
```

### As a library

`binsider` is now available as a Rust library if you want to integrate it into your TUI/Ratatui project!

```toml
[dependencies]
binsider = "0.1"
ratatui = "0.28"
```

See the [documentation](/extras/library/) for more information.

### Improved white theme support

Moths and other creatures that prefer light themes can now enjoy `binsider` too! ü¶ã

We now check the background color of the terminal and use appropriate accent colors. (e.g. white text on a black background)

### Reorder symbol table

The symbols and dynamic symbols table in [static analysis](/usage/static-analysis) are now reordered for better readability:

- Name, Type, Value, Size, Bind, Visibility, Ndx
- Name, Requirements, Type, Value, Size, Bind, Visibility, Ndx

### Sorted shared libraries

The shared libraries in the [general analysis](/usage/general-analysis) are now sorted alphabetically for better readability.

### Squashed bugs

- _(dynamic)_ Fix locating the binary ([#48](https://github.com/orhun/binsider/pull/48))
- _(strings)_ Replace unicode whitespace for correct rendering ([#28](https://github.com/orhun/binsider/pull/28))
- _(file)_ Do not panic if creation time is not supported ([#25](https://github.com/orhun/binsider/pull/25))
- _(tui)_ Stop the event handler on quit ([#24](https://github.com/orhun/binsider/pull/24))
- _(flake)_ Fix test failure on Nix ([#30](https://github.com/orhun/binsider/pull/30))
- _(test)_ Ensure that binary is built before the test runs ([#11](https://github.com/orhun/binsider/pull/11))
